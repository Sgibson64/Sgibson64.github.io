# $\color{green}{Who\ am\ I?}$
### Hey all! My name is Selenea Gibson and my pronouns are She/Her.
I am a graduate student at UMBC in Maryland who studies Geography and Environmental Systems. Currently, I am under a NOAA fellowship which supports me throughout my journey as a student. If I had to give myself a title I would say *Geographer, Social Scientist, and Data Analyst*

# $\color{green}{Project\ Interests}$
My research interests focuses on multiple factors but are within the relm of Socio-economics and Racial diversity:
- Environmental Justice
- BIPOC/NHWhite communities
- Metropolitan areas across the United States
- Capitalism (ew gross!!!)
- Black geographies

# $\color{green}{Influence}$
I have included a list of authors who I have found to be very influential throughout my graduate career. Feel free to look them up and see what books or articles interest you! *A special shoutout to these authors who have shapped me into the researcher that I am today.* 

- Katherine McKittrick
- Tiffany Lethabo King
- Dillon Mahmoudi
- Laura Pulido
- Karoline Barkjohn
- Andrea Clements
- Cedric Robinson
- Paige Glotzer

# $\color{green}{Career\ Goals}$
Working for NOAA or another federal agency to inform everyone as to why social science matters in the GIS and data world would be incredible. Helping people has always been a passion of mine and to do that in a professional setting could open many doors. 

# $\color{green}{Fun\ Facts}$
- I love to be outdoors and spend time with friends or family 
- I have a puppy named Remy who is the light of my life
- Traveling around the world is on my bucket list
