## Introduction
PurpleAir, a citizen science project, uses PM2.5 air quality monitors to record readings of air pollution. Utah native and owner of PurpleAir, Adrian Dybwad, noticed that living near a gravel pit is not ideal for one’s health. “The proximity to the gravel pit meant that when it was windy, dust would blow from the gravel pit into town and the wind blows a lot around here” (Dybwad 2022). PurpleAir measures harmful PM2.5, which are blamed for roughly 90 percent of approximately 100,000 premature deaths in the United States (Masters 2017). Furthermore, low-income and BIPOC communities are located in areas that have higher air pollution than white people (Averett 2022). Averett argues that the actual levels of air pollutants are higher than what is being reported by the air quality monitors and there are not enough monitors to detect the levels of pollution (Averett 2022). The importance of PurpleAir is to place air quality monitors in locations that are at higher risk for air pollution deaths and to monitor areas of low-income and BIPOC people that the EPA is neglecting to do (Dybwad 2022). Connecting to previous classes, the terms “environmental racism” and “inequality” have been discussed immensely. 

The study used quantitative analysis to investigate if air quality monitors spatially represent all residents equally. In order to answer this question first, I identify the geography of EPA and PurpleAir monitors. Second, I test if there is a relationship between the location of air quality monitors and low-income and BIPOC communities. Third, I determine if there is evidence of environmental racism or environmental inequality among air quality sensors. We conducted all analyses using a quantitative approach because quantifying data is a powerful tool for advancing racial and social justice in geography (Mahmoudi 2023).   

## Results
Our findings provide strong evidence that PurpleAir air quality monitors are represented in tracts within core metros that are less BIPOC and richer than the metro. This supports our hypothesis that there is environmental racism and inequality in the placements of air quality monitors.  In figure 1, the map shows little to no PurpleAir monitors in predominantly low-income and BIPOC communities. Figure 2 and 3 are selected Baltimore City tracts that either contain or do not contain a PurpleAir monitor. The demographics show a significant difference in total population, percent BIPOC, and average median household income. These areas that are wealthier and more affluent contain a PurpleAir monitor. Figure 4 is a scatterplot that shows all of the tracts that contains at least 1 PurpleAir air quality monitor within core metros. Baltimore CBSA is shown in the less BIPOC and richer than the Metro quadrant.

Figure 1: Baltimore City showing the geography of tracts that contain PurpleAir air quality monitors. Large portions of Baltimore that are majority low-income and BIPOC show little to no air quality monitors. The findings are conclusive of environmental racism and inequality as a majority of the monitors are located within the White L and only 1 in the Black Butterfly cite.

Figure 2: Figure 2 is a Baltimore City tract that contains a PurpleAir monitor. The tract has a total of population of 1,924 people, it is 20% BIPOC, and has an average median household income of $120,729.

Figure 3 is a Baltimore City tract that does not contain a PurpleAir monitor. The tract has a total of population of 2,109 people, it is 87% BIPOC, and has an average median household income of $23,083.

## Conclusion
The results show how geographic locations of PurpleAir monitors are located in predominantly wealthier and more affluent tracts than low-income and BIPOC communities in core metros. The citizen science project design does not include low-income and BIPOC communities, but rather whiter and more affluent communities instead. These findings would suggest that community engagement and participation of low-income communities are not present in the project design. In addition, there are not enough PurpleAir monitors in Baltimore City.
