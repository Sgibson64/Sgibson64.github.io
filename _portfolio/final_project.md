## Introduction

PurpleAir, a citizen science project, uses PM2.5 air quality monitors to record readings of air pollution. Utah native and owner of PurpleAir, Adrian Dybwad, noticed that living near a gravel pit is not ideal for one’s health. “The proximity to the gravel pit meant that when it was windy, dust would blow from the gravel pit into town and the wind blows a lot around here” (Dybwad 2022). PurpleAir measures harmful PM2.5, which are blamed for roughly 90 percent of approximately 100,000 premature deaths in the United States (Masters 2017). Furthermore, low-income and BIPOC communities are located in areas that have higher air pollution than white people averett cite. Averett argues that the actual levels of air pollutants are higher than what is being reported by the air quality monitors and there are not enough monitors to detect the levels of pollution (Averett 2022). The importance of PurpleAir is to place air quality monitors in locations that are at higher risk for air pollution deaths and to monitor areas of low-income and BIPOC people that the EPA is neglecting to do cite epa and purpleair. Connecting to previous classes, the terms “environmental racism” and “inequality” have been discussed immensely.
